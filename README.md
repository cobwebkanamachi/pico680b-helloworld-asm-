picobug (https://github.com/simple-circuit/picobug) is great one.
I did misc test on picos(genuin pico and rp2040).
I report these here.

1. HELLO WORLD (asm)
   as0.exe downloaded from 
   https://deramp.com/downloads/swtpc/software/6800%20Cross%20Assembler%20(Windows)/
   nop(s) are needed to wait zero flag polls.
3. ALTAIR BASIC run
4. figforth run

Enjoy!
